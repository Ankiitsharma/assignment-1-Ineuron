    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "A string is a data type,  but is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters that can also contain spaces and numbers.\n",
    "variable- variable is a name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name. But the data itself is still contained within the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integer - An integer is colloquially defined as a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0\n",
    "2. Float-The float type in Python represents the floating point number. Float is used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. For example, 97.98\n",
    "3. String- It is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters that can also contain spaces and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.\n",

    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an\n",
    "expression and a statement?\n",

    "'spam' +'spamspam'- it will concatenate 2 string\n",
    "spam*3 - we can not concatenate string with numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    " Because the variable name can not be a number\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
    "version of a value?\n",

    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten'+ 99 +'burritos'\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator."
